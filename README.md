# VirulenceLootSystem

Shroud is an attendance based point system, meaning that points are awarded based on attendance instead of boss kills. 

Gaining Points: All players will start their first raid with 100 points. Players who are in the raid and actively participating will receive 20 points per hour they are in the raid, players who are online and ready to go on time will also receive an additional 20 points, and 20 more points will be given to players still there at the end of the raid. If you do not attend the raid, you will not receive any points for it.

Spending Points: Loot will run through 3 series of rolls. At any phase, type “1” in raid chat to indicate interest in an item.

* Main spec: This will cost half of your points, and is to be used for major upgrades. The highest DKP holder will win with a /roll being used to break ties..

* Main spec low priority: This costs 20 points, and is meant to indicate interest in an item for your main spec, but for smaller upgrades. Anyone who bids here has an equal chance of winning with /roll.

* Off-spec: This is for off-spec rolls. If no one needs it for the main spec, it will cost 20 points. Anyone who bids here has an equal chance of winning with /roll.

* If none of the above apply the item will be disenchanted.

Exceptions: There are a few times when exceptions will be made, mostly for when we need particular players to receive particular items for progressions sake. For example, if we need a certain tank to have gear in order to progress, that player will automatically win the roll, however, that tank will still lose half his points as if he had normally won the roll.

Nether Vortex / Heart of Darkness / other crafting items: In instances where you need more than 1 of an item, you bid when the first item drops and receive the rest of the amount you need until your item is completed. At the time of winning the first one, you will spend half of your DKP. This is subject to change.

Legendaries: Very particular pieces, mostly legendaries, will be decided before the items even drop. These exceptions will be made very clear so that when the item does drop, it will be obvious to everyone who is getting that item. Any disagreements about who should get these items need to happen before raid. It’s fine to disagree about who should get what, but the time to disagree is not during a raid.
